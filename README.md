# Update 9.4.2024

Hello,
I'm sorry for late responses and lack of activity, I'm currently running between 3 projects in daily job and have not much time and much less will to work on this plugin.

So give me a month or two, and hopefully I'll get back on track with it and start solving issues - thanks for all reports.

## Update 28.2.2024

Thank you for help and support - extra thanks to @BokoEnos for a lot of contributions.

This plugin is gaining quite an attention and latest 2.4.0 release (should be public tomorrow) is coming up with a 
[Scene preview](documentation%2Ffeatures%2Fscene_preview.md) - for now it's usage
is VERY limited, but it shows Node's tree structure and allows for Drag&Drop into scripts.

There are some feature requests in Issue list - I don't have time to implement them all within next weeks (maybe months), 
but don't hesitate to propose new ones or vote (just give "thumbs up" on issue) for the one you desire the most.

And ofc please report all issues you find.

## GdScript toolkit (not related to this project)

An independent set of tools for GdScript (Formatter, Linter, and more) that can work together with this plugin.  
For example instead of plugin's built-in formatter, you can use theirs 
<details>
    <summary>gdformat</summary>

- Install by their own tutorial
- Add File Watcher `Settings -> Tools -> File Watchers`
- File type: `GdScript language file`
- Scope: `Project files`
- Program: `/home/{username}/.local/bin/gdformat`
- Arguments: `-l 160 $FilePath$`
- Output paths to refresh: `$FilePath$`
- Enable Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher
- Thanks to @e.sirkova for mentioning it.
</details>
