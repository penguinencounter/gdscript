## Update 16.12.2023

Currently, awaiting 2.0.8 release where all feature should be ready for testing,  
and for now I'll refrain from writing any new features focusing only on bugs that pops-up.

Feel free to report any you find and ofc even new ideas, so they are written down for later.
I thank you for all your support up to now - hopefully instead of just reporting issues we'll move to actually using
this plugin as intended.

So current focus: I'd say get this stable enough that it gets noticed by Gamefromscratch. :D

Currently tested only on Win10 - once it's good enough on it, I'll test it on macOS
