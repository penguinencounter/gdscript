## Update 12.2.2024

With latest version 2.2.0 there's an update for TscnFiles -> highlighting possible via TextMate plugin,
check out [description](https://gitlab.com/IceExplosive/gdscript/-/merge_requests/6) and updated tscn file icon
-> this caused me an error with each opened .tscn file due to cache issue that could not resolve itself and I had to 
clear caches manually (File -> Invalidate Caches... -> Clear file system cache)

Current focus remains bug fixing until it'll be worthy of Gamefromscratch. :)

An independent set of tools for GdScript (Formatter, Linter, and more) that can work together with this plugin.
