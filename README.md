# Installation guide

## Extra tips:
- Dedent with Backspace
```
func losos():
    if (true):
        pass
        |
```
When you hit Backspace at cursor (below pass), IDEa will remove whole line and move you to
previous line, like this:
```
func losos():
    if (true):
        pass|
```
In order to dedent on backspace, you can change editor's settings under:  
Editor -> General -> Smart Keys -> Unindent on Backspace  
![](./screens/unindent.png)  
Hitting Backspace will then just move cursor to the left like this:
```
func losos():
    if (true):
        pass
    |
```
