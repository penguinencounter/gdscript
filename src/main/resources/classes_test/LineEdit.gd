#brief Control that provides single-line string editing.
#desc LineEdit provides a single-line string editor, used for text fields.
#desc It features many built-in shortcuts which will always be available ([kbd]Ctrl[/kbd] here maps to [kbd]Cmd[/kbd] on macOS):

#desc - [kbd]Ctrl + A[/kbd]: Select all text
#desc - [kbd]Up Arrow[/kbd]/[kbd]Down Arrow[/kbd]: Move the caret to the beginning/end of the line
#desc On macOS, some extra keyboard shortcuts are available:
#desc - [kbd]Ctrl + F[/kbd]: Same as [kbd]Right Arrow[/kbd], move the caret one character right
#desc - [kbd]Ctrl + B[/kbd]: Same as [kbd]Left Arrow[/kbd], move the caret one character left
#desc - [kbd]Ctrl + P[/kbd]: Same as [kbd]Up Arrow[/kbd], move the caret to the previous line

#desc - [kbd]Ctrl + A[/kbd]: Same as [kbd]Home[/kbd], move the caret to the beginning of the line
#desc - [kbd]Ctrl + E[/kbd]: Same as [kbd]End[/kbd], move the caret to the end of the line
#desc - [kbd]Cmd + Left Arrow[/kbd]: Same as [kbd]Home[/kbd], move the caret to the beginning of the line
