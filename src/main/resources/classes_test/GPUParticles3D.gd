#brief 3D particle emitter.
#desc 3D particle node used to create a variety of particle systems and effects. [GPUParticles3D] features an emitter that generates some number of particles at a given rate.
#desc Use the [code]process_material[/code] property to add a [ParticleProcessMaterial] to configure particle appearance and behavior. Alternatively, you can add a [ShaderMaterial] which will be applied to all particles.
