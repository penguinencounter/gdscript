#brief Scalable texture-based frame that tiles the texture's centers and sides, but keeps the corners' original size. Perfect for panels and dialog boxes.
#desc Also known as 9-slice panels, NinePatchRect produces clean panels of any size, based on a small texture. To do so, it splits the texture in a 3Ã—3 grid. When you scale the node, it tiles the texture's sides horizontally or vertically, the center on both axes but it doesn't scale or tile the corners.

#desc Repeats the center texture across the NinePatchRect, but will also stretch the texture to make sure each tile is visible in full.
