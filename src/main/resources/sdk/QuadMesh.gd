extends PlaneMesh
#brief Class representing a square mesh facing the camera.
#desc Class representing a square [PrimitiveMesh]. This flat mesh does not have a thickness. By default, this mesh is aligned on the X and Y axes; this rotation is more suited for use with billboarded materials. A [QuadMesh] is equivalent to a [PlaneMesh] except its default [member PlaneMesh.orientation] is [constant PlaneMesh.FACE_Z].
